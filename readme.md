## Yet Another Monochrome Icon Set For KDE Plasma ##

Yet Another Monochrome Icon Set is a clean, adaptive icon theme for KDE Plasma. It automatically adjusts its color based on the background—white on dark backgrounds and black on light ones—for better visibility and a consistent look across the desktop.

The set features major modifications to the SVG path structuring for improved consistency, all done using Inkscape. While it is loosely based on the Orion icon theme by Seth Storm Rosenaa, a number of additional icons have been included based on personal needs, helping to improve coverage and integration within the system.
